# Introduction

Welcome to Mangrove Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop will demonstrate a Random Forest classification mapping workflow using Landsat data. We will cover Image Collection filtering, merging, pre-processing steps, and finally, Random Forest model training, classification and accuracy assessment.

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the trinidad-tobago GEE script repository - [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/trinidad-tobago](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/trinidad-tobago)
3. Create a new script file in your own script repository - name it 'Mangroves Classification - Landsat'. Keep in mind a master copy is available in the above script repository.
4. Check the full script [https://code.earthengine.google.com/76baffb749990e7bbbcb13559de9b873](https://code.earthengine.google.com/76baffb749990e7bbbcb13559de9b873)

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for training and applying a model in Google Earth Engine on satellite data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
