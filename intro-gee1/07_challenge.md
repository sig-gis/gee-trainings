# Challenge

Explore the Earth Engine Data Catalog, and find 3 `ImageCollection` datasets that are relevant for your region and objective. To do this, you can type keywords into the search bar, located above the Earth Engine code. You cannot use any of the datasets previously reviewed in this training module.

For each dataset, import the dataset into your script and filter the dataset to a single image. Then, print the information of the image into the **Console** and add the image to the map, defining the selected bands, min and max and color palette in the `Map.addLayer` call.
